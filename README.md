XMRig is a high performance Alloy (http://alloyproject.org/) CPU miner, with official support for Windows.
Originally based on cpuminer-multi with heavy optimizations/rewrites and removing a lot of legacy code, since version 1.0.0 completely rewritten from scratch on C++.

Based on the code from https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig
